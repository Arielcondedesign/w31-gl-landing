### Service Description

#### What is the detailed description of the service offered by Glocalimits?

We calculate personalised carbon footprints and offer standard compensation packs by country, in this case, the United Kingdom. A big data calculation determines the CO2 emitted per inhabitant per year. Additionally, one-time contributions can be made to plant trees.

#### What exactly does the tree planting and certification service include?

The trees are always planted as CO2 compensation. Depending on the plan, you can plant 2 trees, 174 trees monthly, or the annual pack of 2088 trees equivalent to the emissions of a citizen. If you want a personalised service, you can choose the consultancy option and pay Â£45 per hour. During the consultancy, specific questions will be answered to make a detailed calculation.
