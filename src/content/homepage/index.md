  - title: "Our Mission: Increasing Regenerative Countries"
    content: "We aim to increase the number of self-regenerating countries by reducing consumption and promoting renewable resources, focusing on raising funds in emitting nations to invest in the 3.98% of countries—Bhutan, Kazakhstan, Fiji, Vanuatu, Panama, Laos, Seychelles, and Sudan—that need stronger reforestation policies. These nations have biomass indices that can be easily reversed, helping us work towards having 30% of the world's countries serve as the planet's lungs while reducing emissions from the remaining 70%."

    content: "In the United Kingdom, the numbers are promising; the graph shows a constant reduction from the 1990s to the present. However, considering that the global average is 1.7 Earths, the UK would require 2.5 Earths due to the natural resources we consume at our current rate of living."

    content: "We are committed to a sustainable future by calculating our tree planting quotas based on the tonnes of CO2 emitted per capita. We multiply this figure by 2.5, which represents the index of planets required based on resource consumption. This approach ensures we remain above carbon neutrality."
