    content: "We aim to increase the number of self-regenerating countries by reducing consumption and promoting renewable resources, focusing on raising funds in emitting nations to invest in the 3.98% of countries—Bhutan, Kazakhstan, Fiji, Vanuatu, Panama, Laos, Seychelles, and Sudan—that need stronger reforestation policies. These nations have biomass indices that can be easily reversed, helping us work towards having 30% of the world's countries serve as the planet's lungs while reducing emissions from the remaining 70%."
